## 🗺️ Secret Areas to Explore

### 🎵 The Sound Lab
Check out `generate_sounds.py` - it creates 8-bit sound effects using math! Try changing the frequencies to make different sounds.

### 🎨 The Art Studio
Look at `assets/sprites/battleship_sprites.svg` - it's the visual design in code! SVG files are actually text you can edit.

### 🏗️ The Workshop
Explore the `Makefile` - it's like a recipe book for building the game different ways.

### 🌍 The Portal Room
New! Check out `build_windows.sh` and `build_cross_platform.sh` - these magical scripts let you build the game for computers you don't even have!
